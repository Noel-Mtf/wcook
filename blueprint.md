# Project Blueprint

## Overview

A simple single-page application (SPA) with client-side routing.

## Implemented Features

*   **Client-Side Routing:** The application will use the URL hash to determine which page to display.
*   **Dynamic Content:** The content of the page will be updated dynamically using JavaScript.
*   **Navigation:** A simple navigation bar will allow the user to switch between pages.

## Current Plan

*   Create the basic HTML structure with a navigation bar and a content area.
*   Implement a JavaScript router to handle URL changes.
*   Create two simple content pages.
*   Add basic styling to the application.
